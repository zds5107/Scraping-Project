# Books to Scrape GUI Project
 A Python project that scrapes book data from [BooksToScrape](https://books.toscrape.com/index.html) and stores book product information to a SQLite database. The project also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to scrape books by category. Users can then view and filter the books that have been scrapped based on category, rating and price. Additionally, double-clicking on a book in the GUI will open the corresponding product page.
